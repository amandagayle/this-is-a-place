     <span style="font-family:OpenSans;font-size:30px">THIS IS A PLACE </span>&nbsp;to bring life closer to art. It questions our notions of value - what is considered worthy of<br>
      being displayed and how we engage with the spaces art is presented in- thus challenging our expectations of
      the museum. <br> Inspired by Robert Rauschenberg's <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artwork/robert-rauschenberg-black-market" target="_blank"><i>Black Market (1961)</i></a>
       which invites viewers to complete his artwork through the trading and <br>
      recording of personal objects, here the white wall and archive box are used to represent these ideas of exchange and documentation, </br> bringing along with it an unexpected 
      community of collaborators and a newfound appreciation for everyday culture. </br>
